4 post car lift for the garage? Rennlist Discussion Forums From rennlist.com
Double sized garage doors can be twice the size of a single garage door plus about three feet of space between the vehicles parked in the garage. Current overall height = 75” installing a 6” lift. The size largely depends on the truck sizes that will go into the garage (it’s better to take measures of the largest possible truck). The difference in the 14&#39; door is most likely less than the cost of a new ac cover plus door damage.
