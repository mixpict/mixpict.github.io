KITGARN 1400LBS/60KG Automatic Garage Door Opener Electric From amazon.co.uk
This garage door opener conversion kit alleviates frequency issues from land mobile radio communication systems that are often near military bases. It is relatively easy to add various active mechanical locking devices which usually add two extra locking points to a retractable up and over door, and this then gives three. You do however need a canopy bow arm converter kit which in principal applies forces to the top and lower part of the door panel in order to open the door successfully. The garage door itself as standard is held closed by the electric operator towing arm at the top of the door panel, and this is the only locking on a basic installation.
