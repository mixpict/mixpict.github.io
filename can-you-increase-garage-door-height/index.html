One way to do it would be to get wall extensions for the entire the garage and then cut the roof of the garage off, lifting it up to the height you want it. If by chance you can alter the roof over that area by removing those tails returning onto the header and install a clear span truss, that wall will not bear a load because it will be a gable end wall. However, you need an additional 12” to 18” clearance above the garage door top to accommodate the horizontal tracks and the torsion or extension springs. That way the garage door opening can be raised or lowered to meet the desired opening height.
