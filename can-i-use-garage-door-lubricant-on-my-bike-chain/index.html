No, lithium grease or similar grease compounds are in general not suitable for bike chains. Make sure you don’t use an oil that will attract dust or contains solvents. The best part about using this lube is that you won’t get those “chain tattoos” that you usually get from using wet lube, and you also won’t create a mess wherever you’re storing the bike. This especially works well for the parts of garage door such as the chain rail, metal rollers, ball bearings, hinges, stems, nubs, lock and the arm bar.
