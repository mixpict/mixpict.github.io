<p>One regular garage door issue many homeowners face is clicking the control panel to close your door only to have it immediately reopen once it. The first thing to do when a garage door has a wheel or roller that is popping off the track is to make sure the problem actually originates from the rollers and not from the door itself. Most likely the roller is worn out or the track is damaged (bent) on the curved part that holds the roller in, if that is bent enough the roller can come out.
