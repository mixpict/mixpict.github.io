It’s security 101 to keep your garage door operating smoothly and without any hitches, so when a problem does arise, it’s important that you are able to identify it and know what your next steps are. Should any attempt be made to force the door open from the outside the unique electronic control system will detect the forced intrusion and pulse the door to the closed position. If the spring is broken or the door is stuck partially or in an unbalanced position then trying to release the opener can make the door fall with its full weight. If not, it is likely to be a mechanic issue.
