If we multiply 0.001 kwh x 11.5, we get 0.011 cents for every time we want to open or close garage doors. If the car is on the left side of the garage, and your wiring is also fortuitously able to be on the left side near the garage door, a hpwc with 24&#39; cord could charge both inside and just reach outside on the driveway ( say if your other car was in the garage). In this review, we will show you why. The batteries used in the remote opener have an average life span of about two years.
