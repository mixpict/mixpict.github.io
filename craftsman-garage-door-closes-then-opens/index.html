Craftsman Garage Door Opener Starts To Close Then Stops From garagecarport.blogspot.com
There are safety sensors at the bottom of your garage door. If there is anything that interrupts or breaks that beam when the garage door is trying to close, the door is going to reverse and go back up. If it closes before that distance has been traveled, it thinks something is wrong — and it reopens to help prevent any damage or safety risk. Otherwise, if it forces closes, it may damage the garage door, or worse, may cause an accident.
